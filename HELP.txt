How to play?
-----------------------
* Player 1 begins the game. The striker is ready on the bottom baseline, and the score already starts decreasing with each passing second.
* The player can move the striker on the baseline by using the left and right arrow keys. The striker would not cross the boundary of the baseline. It can also be moved by clicking and dragging the striker using the right mouse button.
* Once the position of the striker is set, the player can adjust the speed of his strike using the up and down arrow keys. The speed can be noted from the power/velocity gradient on the right.
* The player can adjust the angle of his strike using the 'a' and 'c' keys. 'a' for anti-clockwise rotation, and 'c' for clockwise rotation. The angle can be noted by a red line emerging from the center of the striker. It is initialized at 90 degrees.
* The strike can be made by pressing the spacebar key.
* The player can also use the left mouse click, the click will determine the angle and speed of the strike, and once the button is released, the strike will be initiated.
* Once all the coins have stopped moving, the striker is set on the other baseline, for other player's turn.
